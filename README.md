# Email-Parser
Simple Java program to automate parsing and formatting data from form emails

For my day job, I receive about a dozen emails a week for ebook conversion requests. These emails are auto-generated based on an online form on the company’s intranet site. While most of the information I need is in this email, it isn’t formatted in a way that is very conducive to my work. Because I don’t have control over how the email is generated, I decided to write a simple Java program that would read in the email content and break it up into a more usable format: tab and new line delimited for easy copy/paste transfer to a spreadsheet.

A simple GUI with two text fields and a button now allows me to paste in the text from several emails at once, and easily reformat them at the press of a button.
